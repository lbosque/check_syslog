Description
===========
check_syslog is a simple perl script used to check if a remote syslog server is 
working the way it should be.

The script when ejecuted, it sends a message to the remote Syslog server. Then it starts 
an UDP server and wait a response from the Syslog server. Obviously, the Syslog server needs 
to be configured before to be able to send a message back to the script.

Requirements
============
This script is known to work with the next software versions:
* Perl 5.8.8
* Perl threads 1.77 (the version in the Perl 5.8.8 core doesn't work)
* Perl Sys::Syslog 0.27
* Perl Digest::SHA1 2.11

Usage
=====
check_syslog [options]

Options:
  --timeout timeout_seconds      Max time in seconds to keep waiting for a response from the 
                                 syslog server. 
                                 Default: 10

  --ip syslog_ip                 Remote Syslog server IP.
                                 Default: 127.0.0.1

  --facility syslog_facility     Facility used to send the message to the syslog server.
                                 Default: local6

  --level syslog_level           Level used to send the message to the syslog server.
                                 Default: info

  --local-port bind_port         Local port used to bind to wait for the syslog server response.
                                 Default: 2000


Configuration
=============
On the remote side you must have a Syslog UDP capable server.
I use Syslog-NG. It needs a small configuration, so it knows how to send a response to 
the server where the script was launched.
There is a configuration example for the Syslog-NG server. Let's suppose that the script 
is being executed from a server in the IP 10.0.0.2 and the port passed by parameter to the 
script is 2000:

  source lan {
    internal();
    udp(ip(0.0.0.0) port(514));
  };

  filter f_nagios_check {
    host("10.0.0.2");
  };

  destination d_nagios {
    udp("10.0.0.2" port(2000));
  };

  log {
    source(lan);
    filter(f_nagios_check);
    destination(d_nagios);
  };

Nagios usage
============
This script can be executed directly by is mainly made to be used within Nagios.
There is a possible Nagios configuration defining a check of the syslog in a remote server.

define command{
  command_name          check_syslog
  command_line          /usr/local/bin/check_syslog.pl --ip $HOSTADDRESS$ --timeout $ARG1$ --local-port $ARG2$ --facility $ARG3$ --level $ARG4$
}

define hostgroup{
   hostgroup_name       syslogservers
   alias                Syslog Servers
}

define host{
  host_name             logs
  alias                 Syslog Server
  address               10.0.0.1
  use                   generic-host-template
  hostgroups            syslogservers
  register 1
}

define service{
  use                   generic-service
  hostgroup_name        syslogservers
  service_description   Syslog
  check_command         check_syslog!8!2000!local6!info
}
